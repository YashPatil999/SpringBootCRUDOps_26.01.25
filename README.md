CRUD Operations Using Spring Boot Annotations

This document explains how to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot annotations. CRUD operations form the backbone of most applications, enabling interaction with databases for managing data.

Key Spring Boot Annotations for CRUD

1. Controller Layer

Handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate methods.

@RestController: Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. It makes the class RESTful by returning JSON/XML responses.

@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping: Simplify HTTP method-specific endpoint mapping.

2. Service Layer

Handles business logic and interacts with the repository layer.

@Service: Marks the class as a service layer component.

3. Repository Layer

Interacts with the database for performing CRUD operations.

@Repository: Indicates the class is a Data Access Object (DAO) that interacts with the database.

4. Repository Layer

@Entity: Specifies that the class represents a database table.

@Id: Marks a field as the primary key in the database.

@GeneratedValue: Indicates the primary key is auto-generated.
